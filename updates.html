<h1> Site updates!</h1>
   <p>Today I started using git.</p> Git lets me push files from my computer to github and from then on to my site. 
   <p>I think that's great.</p>

   <h2> 29.08.25 : re-editing site </h2>
   <p>I've been working on re-editing the site to improve the layout and design. Time to commit to git again :p </p>
